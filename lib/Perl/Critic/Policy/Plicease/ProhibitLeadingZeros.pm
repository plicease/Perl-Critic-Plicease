# ABSTRACT: Leading zeroes are okay as the first arg to chmod, and other such reasonableness
# VERSION

=head1 SYNOPSIS

perlcriticrc:

 [Plicease::ProhibitLeadingZeros]

code:

 0123;               # not ok
 1234;               # ok
 chmod 0700;         # ok
 mkpath($foo, 0700); # ok

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Perl interprets numbers with leading zeros as octal. If that's what you really want, its
better to use C<oct> and make it obvious.  However, some operations are well known as using
octal such as C<chmod> and C<mkpath> so this policy disallows mistakes like this:

 my $x = 1231;
 my $y = 2345;
 my $z = 0032;

But not non-mistakes like this:

 chmod 0700, "secret_file.txt";

or this:

 use File::Path qw( mkpath );
 
 mkpath("/foo/bar/baz", 1, 0700);

or is this:

 use Path::Class qw( dir );
 
 dir()->mkpath(1,0700);

=head1 AFFILIATION

None.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

This policy is not configurable except for the standard options.

=head1 CAVEATS

Because C<mkpath> is not a built in (as C<chmod> is), this policy does not differentiate between the
C<mkpath> function provided by L<File::Path> or the C<mkpath> method provided by L<Path::Class::Dir>
and arbitrary C<mkpath> function or methods that you or someone else might define.  Also, there is
no way to really check if the object invocant of a C<mkpath> method is really an instance of
L<Path::Class::Dir>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

This policy is based largely on the existing in-core policy, and one in the lax bundle, but adds a
few exceptions that I find useful.
