Some Perl::Critic policies used by Plicease

# DESCRIPTION

The [Perl::Critic::Policy::Plicease](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::Plicease) policies are an eclectic collection of
[Perl::Critic](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic) policies.  They aren't grouped into a theme because some are
application specific and you should review and include them only on a case by
case basis.

- [Plicease::ProhibitLeadingZeros](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::Plicease::ProhibitLeadingZeros)

    This is a slight remix on the prohibit leading zeros policy with some helpful exceptions.

- [Plicease::ProhibitUnicodeDigitInRegexp](https://metacpan.org/pod/Perl::Critic::Policy::Plicease::ProhibitUnicodeDigitInRegexp)

    Prohibit `\d` (match any digit) in regular expressions without the `/a` or `/u` modifier.
